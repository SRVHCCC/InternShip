 a) Reading test and label files: This means opening and understanding the files that contain the test data and labels. You'll need to read through them to know what information they contain.

b) Drawing time series plots with anomaly regions: Time series plots show how data changes over time. Anomaly regions are areas where something unusual or unexpected happens. So, you'll be creating visual representations that highlight these anomalies over time.

c) Performing EDA and finding out root cause: EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It's about looking at the data to understand its main characteristics. Finding the root cause means figuring out why anomalies are happening by exploring the data thoroughly.

d) Finding out the variables which are the root cause for the anomaly: This involves identifying which specific factors or variables in the data are causing the anomalies. By pinpointing these variables, you can understand why certain unusual events occur.

Make sure to check the research folder for the necessary files, and also look for the final output image in the same folder.
